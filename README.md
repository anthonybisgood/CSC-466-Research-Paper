The continued proliferation of deepfake technology and the content it produces has resulted in new challenges to social media networks, weaponizing information in a way that takes advantage of the online ecosystem. Deepfake content, or images and video that have been created via feeding a large dataset of existing media of a particular individual to a generative deep learning model to produce new, artificial-intelligence generated content that often mimics the appearance or speech of said person, has serious potential to effect harm on both a societal or personal level in the hands of a bad actor. In light of these concerns, it has become absolutely essential to understand how to best quantify the emergence of deepfake content on social media platforms.
